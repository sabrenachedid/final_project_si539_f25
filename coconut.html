    <h1 class="headline">Triple Coconut Cream Pie</h1>
    <p class="recipe-intro">Coconut cream pie… the craving to make this comes from the show iCarly, where the main characters were looking for a coconut cream pie from their favorite bakery that was closing down. Ever since I saw the way they searched for that recipe with such passion, I wondered what kind of dessert makes people search and search for just a bite? I finally satisfied that craving a year ago when I was reminded that coconut cream pies existed (I also went through a couple year long phase where I despised coconuts but recently have gotten over it…) through a Tik Tok video showing the most decadent coconut cream pie that looked better than the one on iCarly. I made it my mission to make it and went to the grocery store, collected the ingredients, and got started. It was surprisingly very easy to make and didn’t take me too long. After I completed the masterpiece, I let my friends and family have a bite and to say the least, they were not disappointed. The biggest compliment you can get when making something is someone asking you to make it again in the future and I got a lot of those comments about the pie. It has now stayed in my repertoire of recipes!</p>
    <p class="recipe-source">This triple coconut cream pie from Tom Douglas' Dahlia Bakery is nothing short of a national treasure.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <div class="instruction-group">
            <h3>Pie Crust</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, coconut, diced butter, sugar and salt. Pulse to form coarse crumbs. Gradually add the water, a tablespoon at a time, pulsing each time. Use only as much water as needed for the dough to hold together when gently pressed between your fingers.</li>
                
                <li>Place a large sheet of plastic wrap on the counter and dump the coconut dough onto it. Pull the plastic wrap around the dough forcing it into a rough flattened round. Chill for 30 minutes to an hour before rolling.</li>
                
                <li>To roll the dough, unwrap the round and put it on a lightly floured board. Roll the dough out into a circle about ⅛ inch thick. Trim to a 12-to-13-inch circle.</li>
                
                <li>Transfer the rolled dough to a 9-inch pie pan. Ease the dough loosely into the pan. Trim excess dough to a 1-to-1½-inch overhang. Turn the dough under along the rim and flute the edge. Chill for at least 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°. Place parchment in the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry rim is golden. Remove the paper and beans and bake for another 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-group">
            <h3>Coconut Pastry Cream</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the milk, coconut milk and shredded coconut in a medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add both scrapings and pod to the milk mixture. Place on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture almost comes to a boil.</li>
                
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar and flour until well combined. Temper the eggs by pouring about ⅓ cup of the scalded milk into the egg mixture while whisking. Then add the warmed egg mixture to the saucepan.</li>
                
                <li>Whisk over medium-high heat until the pastry cream thickens and begins to bubble. Keep whisking until very thick, about 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
                
                <li>Add the butter and whisk until melted. Remove the vanilla pod. Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl over ice water. Stir occasionally until cool. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate until completely cold.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-group">
            <h3>Whipped Cream & Assembly</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350º. Spread the coconut chips on a baking sheet. Toast for 7 to 8 minutes, watching carefully and stirring once or twice until lightly browned. Allow to cool.</li>
                
                <li>Whip the heavy cream in a stand mixer with the sugar, vanilla, and salt (if using) until stiff peaks form.</li>
                
                <li>To assemble the pie, spread the coconut pastry cream evenly into the pie crust with a spatula.</li>
                
                <li>Using a piping bag and tip, pipe the whipped cream on top until the pastry cream is completely covered.</li>
                
                <li>Sprinkle the toasted coconut pieces over the top. Use a vegetable peeler or sharp knife to scrape white chocolate into curls and place gently on top.</li>
