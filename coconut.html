    <h1 class="headline">Triple Coconut Cream Pie</h1>
    <p class="recipe-intro">
        Coconut cream pie… the craving to make this comes from the show iCarly, where the main characters were looking for a coconut cream pie from their favorite bakery that was closing down. Ever since I saw the way they searched for that recipe with such passion, I wondered what kind of dessert makes people search and search for just a bite? I finally satisfied that craving a year ago when I was reminded that coconut cream pies existed (I also went through a couple year long phase where I despised coconuts but recently have gotten over it…) through a Tik Tok video showing the most decadent coconut cream pie that looked better than the one on iCarly. I made it my mission to make it and went to the grocery store, collected the ingredients, and got started. It was surprisingly very easy to make and didn’t take me too long. After I completed the masterpiece, I let my friends and family have a bite and to say the least, they were not disappointed. The biggest compliment you can get when making something is someone asking you to make it again in the future and I got a lot of those comments about the pie. It has now stayed in my repertoire of recipes!
