        <p class="recipe-intro">
            Coconut cream pie… the craving to make this comes from the show iCarly, where the main characters were looking for a coconut cream pie from their favorite bakery that was closing down. Ever since I saw the way they searched for that recipe with such passion, I wondered what kind of dessert makes people search and search for just a bite? I finally satisfied that craving a year ago when I was reminded that coconut cream pies existed (I also went through a couple year long phase where I despised coconuts but recently have gotten over it…) through a Tik Tok video showing the most decadent coconut cream pie that looked better than the one on iCarly. I made it my mission to make it and went to the grocery store, collected the ingredients, and got started. It was surprisingly very easy to make and didn't take me too long. After I completed the masterpiece, I let my friends and family have a bite and to say the least, they were not disappointed. The biggest compliment you can get when making something is someone asking you to make it again in the future and I got a lot of those comments about the pie. It has now stayed in my repertoire of recipes!

                <h3>Pie Crust</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, coconut, diced butter, sugar and salt. Pulse to form coarse crumbs. Add 1/4 cup of water and pulse again. Pinch some dough and if it doesn't hold together, add a little more water. When it holds together, dump it out onto a sheet of plastic wrap.</li>
                    <li>Place a large sheet of plastic wrap on the counter and dump the coconut dough onto it. Use the wrap to press and mold the dough into a disk about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To roll the dough, unwrap the round and put it on a lightly floured board. Roll from the center out, lifting and rotating the dough occasionally to keep it from sticking. Roll until you have a circle about 12 inches in diameter.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the rolled dough to a 9-inch pie pan. Trim the overhang to about 3/4 inch and fold it under itself around the rim. Crimp the edges decoratively. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line the chilled pie shell with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights, then bake for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Coconut Pastry Cream</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the milk, coconut milk and shredded coconut in a saucepan. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the pod. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 15 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar and flour until smooth. Gradually whisk in the hot coconut milk mixture. Return everything to the saucepan.</li>
                    <li>Whisk over medium-high heat until the pastry cream thickens and begins to bubble, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the butter and whisk until melted and incorporated. Transfer to a bowl, press plastic wrap directly on the surface, and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Whipped Cream & Assembly</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the coconut chips on a baking sheet and toast until golden brown, about 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let cool completely.</li>
                    <li>Whip the heavy cream until it begins to thicken. Add the sugar, vanilla, and salt (if using). Continue whipping until stiff peaks form.</li>
                    <li>Spread the coconut pastry cream into the cooled pie crust, smoothing the top with a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Pipe the whipped cream on top of the pastry cream in decorative swirls, or spread it evenly with a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the toasted coconut over the whipped cream and add white chocolate curls on top. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Best served within 24 hours.</li>
