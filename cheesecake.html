        <h1 class="headline">Perfect Cheesecake</h1>
        <p class="recipe-intro">CHEESECAKEEEE a classic yummy dessert. This was one of my favorite desserts to make as a teenager. It got to a point where I got sick of eating cheesecake because my family requested that I make it so much. I found my favorite recipe online years ago and have been loyal to it since. I haven't made cheesecake in a couple of years, but I have been craving it lately… The fun part about cheesecake is how customizable it is. You can have different crackers/biscuits for the crust, any sort of flavoring in the cheese batter, and any kind of topping you like.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Prepare the Crust</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven: Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).</li>
                    <li>Process the crust ingredients: Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or blender until finely ground. Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter.</li>
                    <li>Press into a springform pan: Use a 9x2 3/4-inch round springform pan. Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers, until the crumbs are a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan, with maybe just a slight rise along the inside edges of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake: Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.</li>
                    <li>Lower the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).</li>
                    <li>Triple wrap the pan in heavy duty foil: Place a large 18-inch by 18-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil on a flat surface. Place the springform pan in the middle of the foil. Gently fold up the sides of the foil around the pan. Repeat with two more layers of foil to prevent leaks.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Make the Cheesecake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Beat the cream cheese: Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Add the sugar: Add the sugar and beat for 4 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Add the salt and vanilla: Mix just until incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs: Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed for 30 seconds after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add the sour cream: Mix on medium speed until incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Add the heavy cream: Mix on low speed until incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the pan and boiling water: Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan. Prepare 2 quarts of boiling water.</li>
                    <li>Pour the filling: Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.</li>
                    <li>Place in the oven: Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it into the oven on the lower rack.</li>
                    <li>Create water bath: Carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan until the water reaches halfway up the side of the springform pan, about 1 1/4 inches.</li>
                    <li>Bake: Bake at 325°F (160°C) for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Cool in the oven: Turn the oven off and crack open the oven door 1 inch. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven for another hour. This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking.</li>
                    <li>Chill: Carefully cover the top of the cheesecake with foil. Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Finish and Serve the Cheesecake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the sour cream topping: Place sour cream in a medium bowl. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla, and stir until smooth. Chill until ready to serve.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the raspberry sauce (optional): Place raspberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries. Heat on medium, whisking, about 5 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
                    <li>Remove from pan: Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator. Remove the foil from the sides of the pan. Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan. Open the springform latch and gently lift up the sides.</li>
                    <li>Top and serve: Spread the top with the sour cream mixture. Serve plain or drizzle individual slices with raspberry sauce or sauce of your choice.</li>

            <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>Why Use a Water Bath?</h3>
                <p>The water bath adds moisture to the air, creating a humid environment and preventing the cake from drying out or forming cracks. It also provides even, steady heat for that perfectly creamy, velvety texture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>How to Tell When It's Done</h3>
                <p>When finished baking, the outer ring should look slightly puffed and set, but the inner circle should still jiggle just a little bit, like Jell-O after it has set.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                <p>You can prepare the cheesecake up to 3 days before serving. Keep it in the springform mold, covered, and refrigerated. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for about 5 days. You can also freeze cheesecake for up to 1 month.</p>
