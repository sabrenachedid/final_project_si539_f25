        <h1 class="headline">Chocoflan</h1>
        <p class="recipe-intro">Chocoflan!!! Even this dessert has such a cute name to it. This is a Mexican dessert that combines silky flan with a decadent chocolate cake. The best thing about this dessert is that you can change out what kind of cake flavor you want! I was thinking of a traditional Mexican corn cake to pair with the flan next! This was a little more on the difficult side to make just because making flan can be a slightly tricky. The chocolate cake came out so yummy with caramel soaked into it from the flan and I got lucky since the flan turned out deliciously creamy and dreamy… a must try.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by pre-heating your oven to 180°C (350°F). Also grease a 9 inch bundt tin and leave this aside.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Making the Caramel:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the sugar into a pan and place this over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Keep heating this while constantly stirring, until all the sugar has completely melted and is a deep amber colour.</li>
                    <li>Pour this into your bundt tin and swirl the tin around so the caramel coats the bottom of the tin and slightly up the sides too. Leave this aside to set.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Making the Flan Layer:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a blender or food processor, add all the ingredients for the flan. Blend this until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Pour this through a sieve. I recommend doing this twice so the mixture is extra smooth.</li>
                    <li>Pour this into your tin, on top of the set caramel.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>The 1st Bake:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cover the top of your bundt tin with some tinfoil.</li>
                    <li>We're baking the flan in a water bath, so add it into a large baking tin/roasting tray that has high sides. Pour some hot water into this, until the water reaches about halfway up the sides of the bundt tin.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place this into your oven and bake for around 40 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>Making the Cake Batter:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>While that is baking, make the cake batter. In a large bowl, add the cocoa powder, coffee and hot water. Whisk these together, then leave this aside to cool down for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After it has cooled down, add the softened butter, oil and both sugars. Beat these together for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 of the eggs into this and mix. Then add the remaining eggs and buttermilk, mix these in too.</li>
                    <li>Now add the flour and mix just until you get a smooth batter.</li>
                    <li>In a small separate bowl, add the baking soda and then pour the vinegar over it. This will start bubbling, just give it a quick mix, then pour it into your cake batter and whisk this in.</li>
                    <li>Leave this aside until we're ready to use it.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>The 2nd Bake:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>After the flan layer has baked for 40 minutes, take it out of the oven. At this point it will be very jiggly—this is what we want.</li>
                    <li>Pour the cake batter over this. It's okay if the flan and the cake batter start mixing together, don't worry about that.</li>
                    <li>Place this back into your oven, without the tinfoil this time.</li>
                    <li>Bake for around 50 minutes to 1 hour. This time may vary so keep an eye on it. It's done once a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>Once baked, leave it to cool down at room temperature. Then leave it in your fridge to chill and set up overnight.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction-group">
                <h3>The Next Day:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>After it has set overnight, flip it over to take the chocoflan out of the tin. It helps to heat the sides of the tin—you can either do this with a blow torch, or place the tin in a shallow bowl of warm water. The warmth helps release the cake from the tin.</li>
                    <li>Once you have taken it out, cut into it and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
